Common examples of these types of applications include:\\n❓ Question Answering over specific documents\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database\\n💬 Chatbots\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: Chat-LangChain\\n🤖 Agents\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha\\nGetting Started#\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\nGetting Started Documentation\\nModules#\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nLLMs: This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.\\nDocument Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.\\nUtils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nChat: Chat models are a variation on Language Models that expose a different API - rather than working with raw text, they work with messages. LangChain provides a standard interface for working with them and doing all the same things as above.\\nUse Cases#\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\nAgents: Agents are systems that use a language model to interact with other tools. These can be used to do more grounded question/answering, interact with APIs, or even take actions.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nData Augmented Generation: Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. Examples of this include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.\\nQuestion Answering: Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nGenerate similar examples: Generating similar examples to a given input. This is a common use case for many applications, and LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nCompare models: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\nReference Docs#\\nAll of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\\nReference Documentation\\nLangChain Ecosystem#\\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\nAdditional Resources#\\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\\nGlossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\\nGallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\\nDeployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\\nDiscord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\\nTracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\\nProduction Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we’d love to offer more comprehensive support.

            "Document Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.\n",
            "Utils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.\n",
            "Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n",
            "Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\n",
            "Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\n",
            "Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n",

LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.

Let’s first walk through how to use the utilities from langchain.memory import ConversationKGMemory from langchain.llms import OpenAI llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationKGMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({\"input\": \"say hi to sam\"}, {\"ouput\": \"who is sam\"}) memory.save_context({\"input\": \"sam is a friend\"}, {\"ouput\": \"okay\"}) memory.load_memory_variables({\"input\": 'who is sam'}) {'history': 'On Sam: Sam is friend.'} We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model). memory = ConversationKGMemory(llm=llm, return_messages=True) memory.\n",
            "0.84: .md .pdf Key Concepts  Contents  Memory Conversational Memory Entity Memory Key Concepts# Memory# By default, Chains and Agents are stateless, meaning that they treat each incoming query independently. In some applications (chatbots being a GREAT example) it is highly important to remember previous interactions, both at a short term but also at a long term level. The concept of “Memory” exists to do exactly that. Conversational Memory# One of the simpler forms of memory occurs in chatbots, where they remember previous conversations. There are a few different ways to accomplish this: Buffer: This is just passing in the past N interactions in as context. N can be chosen based on a fixed number, the length of the interactions, or other! Summary: This involves summarizing previous conversations and passing that summary in, instead of the raw dialogue itself.\n",
            "0.84: of the raw dialogue itself. Compared to Buffer, this compresses information: meaning it is more lossy, but also less likely to run into context length limits. Combination: A combination of the above two approaches, where you compute a summary but also pass in some previous interactions directly! Entity Memory# A more complex form of memory is remembering information about specific entities in the conversation. This is a more direct and organized way of remembering information over time. Putting it a more structured form also has the benefit of allowing easy inspection of what is known about specific entities.
